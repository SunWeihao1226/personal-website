  My previous internship as a Data Engineer in TripleEagle Logistics Vancouver involved developing internally used billing 
  calculating systems and maintaining and updating the companyâ€™s database. I also had a research experience involving developing 
  a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve partial differential equations in battery modelling. 
  My side projects are mostly about developing, tunning, and evaluating machine learning models and performing analysis on 
  large datasets.`,
